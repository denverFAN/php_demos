There are code examples on PHP using Yii2 framework that I've implemented in the real projects.

It's only a small part of a project which I've worked with. It's about researching, finding and booking tours.
Here it is a part of the functional that allows you to create/delete tour, view tour, make an order adding it to the cart, add necessary order details and procced to the payment page.
There are all controllers, models, views (html/css was created by front-end developer) for implementing that things.

There is a WikiParser in the "components" directory. 
It gets nice article preview (with main image) from Wikipedia using only the link that user posted.
